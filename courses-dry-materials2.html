                <h3 class = "grey">Course Description</h3>
                <p>Over the 5 sessions we will explore a range of dry drawing materials  (eg. pencils, chalk, charcoal, conté)  in combination with different types of papers. Through these different combinations, we will become more sensitive to the feel and potential of the materials we choose. As well as working with mark making tools we will constantly be aware of the importance of erasure, building an image up and when necessary paring it back again. We will consider the usual use of materials, particularly within specific fields or contexts, and also the challenges and surprises of misusing and experimenting with them. This course is complemented by and extends what you will learn in the <a href="courses-wet-materials.html" title="Wet Materials" style="color: black">Wet Materials</a> course.
                </p>
                <h3 class = "grey">Who</h3>
                  <p>We have designed this course for students from different disciplines who feel that drawing could become a useful part of their thinking process or who are already drawing, or for lapsed drawers who want to get back into it. The evening course is timed with creative professionals in mind. This course is suitable for students of all ages (aged 18+) and levels of experience. This is drawing as visual thinking, rather than an intention to make art works. We like the idea of exchange and look for students with open thinking and an enjoyment in making.

                <h3 class = "grey"> Materials and Useful Info </h3>
                <p> We have put together a list at our local art shop of the materials you will need for this course, You may have some or all of the materials already but if you are starting from scratch, with a 10% discount the materials list costs approximately £40. We will email you the materials list on booking.</p>
                <p> Lunch is not provided but there are many local delis and cafes, or you can bring a lunchbox. If it is sunny the local parks are beautiful
                    and if the weather is less compliant then you can eat inside.
                </p>
