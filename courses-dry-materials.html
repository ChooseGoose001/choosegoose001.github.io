                <h3 class = "grey">Course Description</h3>
                <p>Over the 5 sessions we will explore a range of dry drawing materials in combination with different papers. Through using different materials, and combinations, we will become more sensitive to the feel and potential of the materials at hand. As well as working with mark making tools (eg. pencils, chalk, charcoal, conté) we will constantly be aware of the importance of erasure, building an image up and when necessary paring it back again. We will consider the usual use of materials, particularly within specific fields or contexts, and also the challenges and surprises of misusing and experimenting with them. This course is complemented by the following Wet Materials course.
                </p>
                <h3 class = "grey">Who</h3>
                <p>We have designed this course for students from different disciplines who are already drawing or who feel that drawing could become a useful part of their thinking process. This course is suitable to students of all ages (aged 18+) and levels of experience.
                </p>
				<p>More information on this course will be added shortly. Please<a href="contact.html" style="color: black;"> contact us</a> if you have any questions.</p>
                <!--<h3 class = "grey">Course Outline</h3>
                <p>Each morning we will introduce a set of drawing exercises and tasks. The afternoon sessions will build on this with time for looking and independent experimentation. Throughout the day there will be contextual interventions and discussion to find a shared language to talk about everything to do with drawing (the whole world, universe, and beyond)
                </p>
                <h3 class = "grey">Sketching - exploring materials</h3>
                <p>Monday 21th June 2021
                In the morning  we will reconsider our sensitivity to the pencil and see what we can make it do through a number of specific exercises. We will be looking at mark making both in the context it is used and considering the character of the marks themselves. In the process developing a library of marks. In the afternoon we will also work with a range of paper and pencils/inks/conte/charcoal to feel and see the different possibilities inherent in various media.
                </p>
                <h3 class = "grey">Observing</h3>
                <p>Tuesday 22th June 2021
                Building on our findings from Day 1 we are aiming to use drawing as a tool to notice and notate what we are seeing and the visual world around us. Working from still life/nature observation allows us to apply a sensitivity to materials serving specific ends. Here we will have a chance to incorporate some of our range of mark making considering a familiar object within a more complex context.
                </p>
                <h3 class = "grey">Imagining</h3>
                <p>Wednesday 23rd June 2021
                With the experience from the past two days this is an opportunity to play with skills we have been developing through making images, forms and shapes from memory and using our mind’s eye. We will start the day with some games to encourage intuitive working and associative thinking, this will free us up to find inventive solutions.
                </p>
                <h3 class = "grey">Collaborating</h3>
                <p>Thursday 24th June 2021
                On the final day we will develop drawings together and discover common ground incorporating our stylistic differences. This will allow us to recognise different ways of seeing, and representing the same thing. It will be a chance to collaborate through responsive drawing, collaging and recycling on some larger pieces.
                </p>-->
