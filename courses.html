                <h3>Revisiting Basics</h3>
                <p>
                    Dates and Times: Monday 21st June - Thursday 24th June 2021
                    4 day course - 10am - 4pm (Lunchbreak 1-2pm)
                </p>
                <h3>Course Description</h3>
                <p>Over the four days of the course we have a daily topic which through drawing will introduce ideas and an awareness of the visual choices we make. Each day will build on learning and experience from the previous day. In a space where there is no qualitative judgement there will be a chance to open up beyond the stylistic habits we all develop as we repeatedly draw. Working together as a group we aim to help you discover a wider range in your drawing and to draw with renewed flow and confidence.
                </p>
                <h3>Who</h3>
                <p>We have designed this course for students (aged 18+) from different disciplines who are already drawing or who feel that drawing could become a useful part of their thinking process. This is drawing as visual thinking, rather than an intention to make art works. We like the idea of exchange and look for students with open thinking and an enjoyment in making.
                </p>
                <h3>Course Outline</h3>
                <p>Each morning we will introduce a set of drawing exercises and tasks. The afternoon sessions will build on this with time for looking and independent experimentation. Throughout the day there will be contextual interventions and discussion to find a shared language to talk about everything to do with drawing (the whole world, universe, and beyond)
                </p>
                <h3>Sketching - exploring materials</h3>
                <p>Monday 21th June 2021
                In the morning  we will reconsider our sensitivity to the pencil and see what we can make it do through a number of specific exercises. We will be looking at mark making both in the context it is used and considering the character of the marks themselves. In the process developing a library of marks. In the afternoon we will also work with a range of paper and pencils/inks/conte/charcoal to feel and see the different possibilities inherent in various media.
                </p>
                <h3>Observing</h3>
                <p>Tuesday 22th June 2021
                Building on our findings from Day 1 we are aiming to use drawing as a tool to notice and notate what we are seeing and the visual world around us. Working from still life/nature observation allows us to apply a sensitivity to materials serving specific ends. Here we will have a chance to incorporate some of our range of mark making considering a familiar object within a more complex context.
                </p>
                <h3>Imagining</h3>
                <p>Wednesday 23rd June 2021
                With the experience from the past two days this is an opportunity to play with skills we have been developing through making images, forms and shapes from memory and using our mindâ€™s eye. We will start the day with some games to encourage intuitive working and associative thinking, this will free us up to find inventive solutions.
                </p>
                <h3>Collaborating</h3>
                <p>Thursday 24th June 2021
                On the final day we will develop drawings together and discover common ground incorporating our stylistic differences. This will allow us to recognise different ways of seeing, and representing the same thing. It will be a chance to collaborate through responsive drawing, collaging and recycling on some larger pieces.
