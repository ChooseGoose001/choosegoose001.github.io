                <h2>The Studio</h3>
                <p>The studio will be a space to draw together and a platform for visual exchange. It will be a space for observing and looking, discussing drawing, collaborating, sharing ideas where all of us can learn something new through drawing. Our sessions are planned to guide visually intuitive research, led through specific drawing tasks. 
                </p>
                <h2 class = "grey">Studio Manifesto</h3>

                <h3 class = "grey">What it is</h2> 

               <p> A studio
                Investigation into process
                Exchange 
                Generating lively discussion
                Space for quiet concentration
                Non hierarchical
                Renewal/ revisiting (revision is key and people will not be satisfied with results - PART OF learning process - what can we learn through the activity)
                Visual Space
                Nonlinear but structured
                Angels/ Shapeshifters
                </p>
                <br>
                Time for looking
                <br>
                Looking with the history of drawing interwoven into practise
                <br>
                Emotional qualities - giving courage and encouragement
                <br>
                Love drawing share in encouraging and none judgemental
                Analytical but non-judgmental
                <br>
                Sensitivity to materials and scale
                <br>
                Learning through making - learning to talk through making 
                <br>
                Mistakes are part of the process
                <br>
                Being aware that you are choosing - Awareness of approach that is chosen
                <br>
                Discuss the work with mutual respect
                <br>
                A sense of value for drawing in itself 
                <br>

                <h3 class="grey">What is it not</h2>
                <br>
                Not a school
                <br>
                No nudes
                <br>
                Not academic
                <br>
                Not how to
                <br>
                Art history as a disconnected discipline 
                <br>
                Not about making finished art works
                <br>
                Not outcome based
                <br>
                No binary good/bad 
                <br>
                No prizes no medals no certificates
                <br>
                <p>CODE OF CONDUCT/ Housekeeping</p>

                Students will need to sign this code of conduct when booking a class 

                There must be a mutual respect and a use of constructive language for discussion and critique.

                We insist upon respect for diversity and appropriate sexual conduct.

                Unless otherwise instructed drawing time is quiet, mobile phones should be kept in silent mode and try to avoid interruptive use

                It is important to follow any health and safety instructions carefully.

                The studio has been put together with love and attention and we ask you to look after it carefully.
                The studio will be a space to draw together and a platform for visual exchange. It will be a space for observing and looking, discussing drawing, collaborating, sharing ideas where all of us can learn something new through drawing. Our sessions are planned to guide visually intuitive research, led through specific drawing tasks.
