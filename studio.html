                <h3>The Studio</h3>
                <p>The studio will be a space to draw together and a platform for visual exchange. It will be a space for observing and looking, discussing drawing, collaborating, sharing ideas where all of us can learn something new through drawing. Our sessions are planned to guide visually intuitive research, led through specific drawing tasks.

                Studio Manifesto

                What it is 

                A studio
                Investigation into process
                Exchange 
                Generating lively discussion
                Space for quiet concentration
                Non hierarchical
                Renewal/ revisiting (revision is key and people will not be satisfied with results - PART OF learning process - what can we learn through the activity)
                Visual Space
                Nonlinear but structured
                Angels/ Shapeshifters

                Time for looking

                Looking with the history of drawing interwoven into practise

                Emotional qualities - giving courage and encouragement

                Love drawing share in encouraging and none judgemental
                Analytical but non-judgmental

                Sensitivity to materials and scale

                Learning through making - learning to talk through making 

                Mistakes are part of the process

                Being aware that you are choosing - Awareness of approach that is chosen

                Discuss the work with mutual respect


                A sense of value for drawing in itself 


                What is it not

                Not a school

                No nudes

                Not academic

                Not how to

                Art history as a disconnected discipline 

                Not about making finished art works

                Not outcome based

                No binary good/bad 

                `No prizes no medals no certificates




                CODE OF CONDUCT/ Housekeeping



                Students will need to sign this code of conduct when booking a class 

                There must be a mutual respect and a use of constructive language for discussion and critique.

                We insist upon respect for diversity and appropriate sexual conduct.

                Unless otherwise instructed drawing time is quiet, mobile phones should be kept in silent mode and try to avoid interruptive use

                It is important to follow any health and safety instructions carefully.

                The studio has been put together with love and attention and we ask you to look after it carefully.
                The studio will be a space to draw together and a platform for visual exchange. It will be a space for observing and looking, discussing drawing, collaborating, sharing ideas where all of us can learn something new through drawing. Our sessions are planned to guide visually intuitive research, led through specific drawing tasks.
