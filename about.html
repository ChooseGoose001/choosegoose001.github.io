                  <h3> About </h3>
                      <p>
                        The starting point for eyetopencil is a 20 year conversation between the founders,  Luci Eyers, a painter, and Antje Southern, an art historian, where drawing has been a central and recurring theme. We would like to extend this conversation through drawing together, discussion, and sharing skills and ideas.
                      </p>
                  
                  <h3 style = "color: black;">Luci Eyers:</h3>
                  <p>
                        Luci is a painter, she studied at the Slade and from ‘90s also worked in artists collectives on media art projects. From ‘98 she taught for 5 years in the Photography Department at Rochester School of Art. In 2012 Luci participated in the inaugural year for the studio programme at Turps Art School and is currently a mentor on their Correspondence Course. She works predominantly in watercolour with images sourced from her imagination however looking at drawing in its widest sense has always been and important part of her practice. Drawing and a sense of line are core to her work.

                  <h3 style="color: black;">Antje Southern:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Antje Southern studied art history at UCL and the Warburg Institute. She taught connoisseurship at Christie’s Education in the 90s and currently runs the contextual studies programme for the foundation year at the Royal Drawing School. Within her teaching she uses drawing interventions as a thinking model to approach art history. Passionate about ceramics and female explorers, her research interests are informed by working with practising artists, and focuses on drawing as a tool for understanding and articulating humanity and its histories.
