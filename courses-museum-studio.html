                <h3 class = "grey">Course Description</h3>
                <p>We will start each session in one of London’s public collections, with our sketchpads and drawing kits. This course will be led by Antje Southern, an art historian, and Luci Eyers, a painter,  looking at a specific aspect of the Museum’s collection and then carrying out a complementary drawing task. The learning is multi-faceted; part of this is art history and discussion, but crucially we learn through observation of artworks, and then through what we discover as these ideas coalesce in drawing. Looking at different objects in the Museum will allow us to investigate materials and design as well as the artistry and craftsmanship of the objects. We will return to the Drawing Studio for the afternoon and pick up on threads from the morning, developing ideas further through drawing and discussion.</p>
                <h3 class = "grey">Who</h3>
                    <p>We have designed this course for students from different disciplines who feel that drawing could become a useful part of their thinking process or who are already drawing, or for lapsed drawers who want to get back into it. This course is suitable for students of all ages (aged 18+) and levels of experience.  This is also an opportunity to consider craftsmanship and find unexpected visual inspiration through drawing in the Museum, so would be suitable for makers.

                <h3 class = "grey"> Materials and Useful Info </h3>
                <p> Bring with you a selection of pencils (ideally: HB, 2B and 4B), and an eraser, a sharpener which catches the shavings, and a plain A4 sketchbook (ideally: hard backed or a clipboard for support).</p>
                <p> Travel will be independent. Lunch is not provided but there are many local delis and cafes, or you can bring a lunchbox. If it is sunny the local parks are beautiful
                    and if the weather is less compliant then you can eat inside.
                </p>
                <p>Here is a <a href = "contact.html" style = "color: black;">map</a> of where the Drawing Studio is, we will email information about the meeting point at the museum on booking.</p>
				<p>We hope to run the courses in our drawing studio, as described, however if it is necessary due to COVID regulations, we will will offer our courses online.
